          <p><span>How Do We Use Cookies?</span></p>
          <p><span>Cookies are small pieces of information (small files) stored on your equipment (such as your mobile). As the website owner, we
              place cookies when you visit our website, as do the third-parties that we work with directly to deliver games and ads. While we control
              this process, you can use our consent tool to make choices about the cookies you wish to allow and the personal data processing that
              occurs with the help of those cookies. Because of the way online games and ads work, third parties with whom we do not work directly,
              but who also deliver games and ads via our website, may also place cookies. This is not something we can control.</span></p>
